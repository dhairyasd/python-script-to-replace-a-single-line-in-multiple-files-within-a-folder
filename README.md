This is a simple python script that updates a single line within multiple files.
This python file is meant to update a line "auth-user-pass" to "auth-user-pass pass.txt".
The file is really easy to read and you can make changes to the replace line based on your needs.
There is a PATH variable that requires the path of the folder which consists of all the files.
Due to the simplicity of the script, you can make multiple versions for the same script.
